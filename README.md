# kubebench

The goal of Kubebench is to make it easy to run benchmark jobs on [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) with various system and model settings. Kubebench enables benchmarks by leveraging Kubeflow's capability of managing TFJobs, as well as [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) based workflows.
